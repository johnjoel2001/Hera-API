# IMPORTANT: Do not include any raw research text or fragments from the context at the beginning of your response. Start directly with the structured explanation below.

# {question}

# ---

# ### üåü 1. Introduction
# - You received a **{category} fertility score of {score:.2f}%**. This means your current chances of natural conception are estimated at this percentage.
# - This is **not a diagnosis**, but a data-driven guide to help you make informed decisions.
# - If this is an improvement from your previous report, it's worth celebrating ‚Äî even small gains reflect your efforts and potential for continued progress.

# ---

# ### üîç 2. Detailed Review for Each Factor

# For each factor (e.g., Motility, Concentration, Volume), provide:

# - **Subheading**: e.g., `üåü 1. Motility`
# - **SHAP Impact**: Mention its value and whether it's positive or negative (e.g., "SHAP Impact: -0.547 (moderate negative)").
# - **Value Comparison**:  
#   - `Previous Value: X` (MUST USE PREVIOUS_VALUE_FOR_[FEATURE] FROM DATA ABOVE - DO NOT USE CURRENT VALUE)
#   - `Current Value: Y` (MUST USE CURRENT_VALUE_FOR_[FEATURE] FROM DATA ABOVE - DO NOT USE PREVIOUS VALUE)
#   - `Change: üî∫ (+Z)` or `üîª (-Z)` (USE THE EXACT CHANGE_FOR_[FEATURE] FROM DATA ABOVE)
# - **Explanation**: Explain how this factor influences fertility and how it contributed to the score.
# - **Appreciation**: If there's an improvement, **gently acknowledge the positive change and encourage continued momentum**.
# - **Suggestions**: Provide friendly, practical tips or medical guidance to improve or maintain the factor (e.g., lifestyle, supplements, hydration).
# - **Cite claims inline**: (Title by Author).

# ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: When displaying Previous Value and Current Value, you MUST:
# 1. For Previous Value: Use PREVIOUS_VALUE_FOR_[FEATURE] from the data section
# 2. For Current Value: Use CURRENT_VALUE_FOR_[FEATURE] from the data section  
# 3. These values MUST BE DIFFERENT (unless there was truly no change)
# 4. Example: If PREVIOUS_VALUE_FOR_MOTILITY: 50.0 and CURRENT_VALUE_FOR_MOTILITY: 43.9, then show "Previous Value: 50.0" and "Current Value: 43.9"

# DO NOT use the same number for both previous and current values.

# Be encouraging and informative ‚Äî this is a journey, not a test.

# ---

# ### ‚úÖ 3. Summary & Next Steps

# - üìà **Improved Factors**: List any feature(s) that improved, and congratulate the user for their progress.
# - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Features Needing Focus**: List any factors with strong negative SHAP impacts and how they can be addressed.
# - üß≠ **Personalized Next Steps**: Offer a kind, constructive treatment suggestion based on the score.
# - Final recommendation: **{treatment}**

# ---

# üéØ **Tone Reminder**: Your tone should be warm, empathetic, and non-judgmental. Think like a supportive coach or fertility companion ‚Äî informed, caring, and optimistic.

A machine learning model predicted a **{category} fertility score of {score:.2f}%**, representing the probability of achieving successful natural pregnancy within the next 12 months.

IMPORTANT: Do not include any raw research text or fragments from the context at the beginning of your response. Start directly with the structured explanation below.

{question}

---

### üåü 1. Introduction
- You received a **{category} fertility score of {score:.2f}%**. This means your current chances of natural conception are estimated at this percentage.
- This is **not a diagnosis**, but a data-driven guide to help you make informed decisions.
- If this is an improvement from your previous report, it's worth celebrating ‚Äî even small gains reflect your efforts and potential for continued progress.

---

### üîç 2. Detailed Review for Each Factor

For each factor (e.g., Motility, Concentration, Volume), provide:

- **Subheading**: e.g., `üåü 1. Motility`
- **SHAP Impact**: Mention its value and whether it's positive or negative (e.g., "SHAP Impact: -0.547 (moderate negative)").
- **Value Comparison**:  
  - `Previous Value: X` (MUST USE PREVIOUS_VALUE_FOR_[FEATURE] FROM DATA ABOVE - DO NOT USE CURRENT VALUE)
  - `Current Value: Y` (MUST USE CURRENT_VALUE_FOR_[FEATURE] FROM DATA ABOVE - DO NOT USE PREVIOUS VALUE)
  - `Change: üî∫ (+Z)` or `üîª (-Z)` (USE THE EXACT CHANGE_FOR_[FEATURE] FROM DATA ABOVE)
- **Explanation**: Explain how this factor influences fertility and how it contributed to the score.
- **Appreciation**: If there's an improvement, **gently acknowledge the positive change and encourage continued momentum**.
- **Suggestions**: Provide friendly, practical tips or medical guidance to improve or maintain the factor (e.g., lifestyle, supplements, hydration).


‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: When displaying Previous Value and Current Value, you MUST:
1. For Previous Value: Use PREVIOUS_VALUE_FOR_[FEATURE] from the data section
2. For Current Value: Use CURRENT_VALUE_FOR_[FEATURE] from the data section  
3. These values MUST BE DIFFERENT (unless there was truly no change)
4. Example: If PREVIOUS_VALUE_FOR_MOTILITY: 50.0 and CURRENT_VALUE_FOR_MOTILITY: 43.9, then show "Previous Value: 50.0" and "Current Value: 43.9"

DO NOT use the same number for both previous and current values.

Be encouraging and informative ‚Äî this is a journey, not a test.

---

### üìä Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) Score Tracking

If this is the first assessment, explain:
- **First Test**: This is your baseline - we need more data to measure consistency
- **Next Steps**: Upload future reports to see how reliable your scores are over time
- **Why It Matters**: Consistency helps distinguish real changes from normal variation


If multiple assessments are available, include:
- **Consistency Level**: Mention the ICC result and explain how it was calculated
- **What This Means**: How confident you can be in score changes
- **Your Journey**: Show the progression of scores over time


---

### ‚úÖ Summary & Next Steps

- üìà **Improved Factors**: List any feature(s) that improved, and congratulate the user for their progress.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Features Needing Focus**: List any factors with strong negative SHAP impacts and how they can be addressed.
- üß≠ **Personalized Next Steps**: Offer a kind, constructive treatment suggestion based on the score.

---

üéØ **Tone Reminder**: Your tone should be warm, empathetic, and non-judgmental. Think like a supportive coach or fertility companion ‚Äî informed, caring, and optimistic.
